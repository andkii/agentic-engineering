# eng-laws

Source of truth for engineering laws that apply across all projects using AI-assisted development.

## What this is

These conventions govern how work is created, executed, reviewed, and recorded in any project where Claude Code (or equivalent agentic tools) are part of the development workflow. They are not tied to any specific stack, language, or codebase.

Each project's `CLAUDE.md` incorporates the laws from `ENGINEERING_LAWS.md` via Claude Code's native `@import` syntax, alongside project-specific overrides (verification commands, architecture notes, resource lifecycle rules, etc.).

## How to use in a project

Claude Code supports `@path/to/file.md` imports in `CLAUDE.md`. Add this repo as a git submodule at `.eng-laws/` and reference it at the top of the project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
@.eng-laws/ENGINEERING_LAWS.md

# Project-specific overrides below
```

Or, if both repos live under the same parent directory (e.g. `~/dev/`):

```markdown
@../eng-laws/ENGINEERING_LAWS.md
```

The laws are read through the import, not copied. A submodule or a pinned checkout stays on one version until you deliberately bump it, so updating is a conscious step.

## What goes here vs in project CLAUDE.md

| Here (`ENGINEERING_LAWS.md`) | Per-project `CLAUDE.md` |
|---|---|
| Record Laws (session close, work tracking) | Verification command (`./scripts/check`, `pytest`, etc.) |
| Worktree workflow | Resource lifecycle rules (Redis, DB, HTTP patterns) |
| Ticket discipline (Plane in the examples; any tracker works) | Architecture overview |
| Code quality laws (read-before-claim, declarative/imperative, debt-in-band) | Domain-specific key rules |
| Review gate rules | Project structure |

## Plugin

This repo is also a Claude Code plugin and a single-plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/`). It enforces mechanically what the laws state in prose.

| Component | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Bash guard hook | `hooks/guard-bash.sh` (wrapper) and `hooks/guard.py`, registered in `hooks/hooks.json` | Blocks `git revert` (not `git revert --help`); `--no-verify` (including `commit -n`, `am -n`, abbreviations, `-c core.hooksPath`, and `git config core.hooksPath`); and any change to `core.hooksPath`. These are the commands a git hook cannot see |
| Git hooks | `githooks/pre-commit`, `githooks/pre-push` | Refuse a commit on `main`/`master` and any push that updates or deletes `refs/heads/main` or `refs/heads/master`. Git runs them with the real branch and the real remote refs, for every agent and person. Skipped by `--no-verify`, which the guard blocks. Active only after the one-time setup below |
| Verifier agent | `agents/verifier.md` | Read-only (`Read, Grep, Glob`) evaluator that checks acceptance criteria against the changed files with `file:line` evidence |
| Block log and report | `hooks/blocklog.py`, `hooks/rules.py`, `hooks/report.py` | Records each block (rule id, git subcommand, time, redacted command) so false positives can be counted per rule; see "Block log" below |
| Guard tests | `tests/test_guard.py` | Regression corpus of block and allow cases. Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` |

**Guard requirements and limits.**
- Requires `python3` (standard library only). It fails closed: a missing `python3`, an unreadable payload, or an unparseable git command blocks the call with a message instead of silently allowing it.
- It tokenizes the command and judges only what sits at command position, so quoted text, `echo` arguments, comments and heredoc bodies never trigger it. It looks inside `if`/`for`/`while`/`case` bodies, `{ }` groups, functions, `$(...)`, backticks, `bash -c`, `eval`, `find -exec`, and wrappers such as `sudo`, `env`, `timeout`, `xargs`.
- It does not track the working directory, the branch, or shell variables. Protecting the default branch is the job of the git hooks, which see the real state.
- It is a guard against mistakes, not a sandbox. Out of scope: variable indirection (`g=git; $g revert`), aliases, scripts, `ssh`/`watch`/`parallel`/`env -S` wrappers, `GIT_*` environment overrides, and deliberate obfuscation. Edits made through tools other than Bash are not covered.
- It blocks `--no-verify` unconditionally, which is stricter than the law's "unless the user explicitly requests it". If the user requests it, the user runs the command themselves (the `!` prefix) or disables the plugin for that session.

A plugin-root `CLAUDE.md` is not loaded as context, so the laws still reach a project through the `@import` above; the plugin adds enforcement only.

Install: `claude plugin marketplace add andkii/eng-laws#<tag>` then `claude plugin install eng-laws@eng-laws`.

### Git hooks setup

Git runs hooks only when `core.hooksPath` points at them, and that setting is per clone (every worktree of a clone shares it). The guard blocks any Bash command that mentions `core.hooksPath`, so a person runs this once in each clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath ~/.claude/eng-laws/githooks
```

Use the absolute path of the pinned checkout (the shell expands `~` when you run it); a relative path would resolve inside each project and find nothing. Updating the pinned checkout updates the hooks. `--no-verify` skips both hooks, and changing `core.hooksPath` turns them off, which is why the guard keeps those two bans. Without this setup nothing protects the default branch except the laws and server-side branch protection, where the host offers it.

### Block log

Every block appends one JSON line to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/blocks.jsonl`. Claude Code exports `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` to hook processes (hooks reference, "Command hook fields"); it resolves to `~/.claude/plugins/data/<id>/` (for this plugin, `~/.claude/plugins/data/eng-laws-eng-laws/`), is kept across plugin updates, and is deleted when the plugin is uninstalled from its last location. It is outside every repository. If the variable is unset or the write fails, logging is skipped silently and the block still happens.

Each entry holds: `id` (8 hex chars, used to mark it), `ts` (UTC), `rule` (an id from `hooks/rules.py`), `sub` (git subcommand, `null` when unknown), `cwd` (basename only), and `cmd`. `cmd` is only the blocked git invocation's own words (at most 16), never the rest of the command line, so a secret in a chained `curl`, `docker login` or `export` cannot reach the log. For a command that would not parse (`unparseable-git`) it is the first 4 words from the first `git`; for an unreadable payload it is `null`. Each word is redacted on its own: a word containing whitespace (a commit message, a header value) becomes `<text>`, URL userinfo, values of `name=value` words whose name contains `pass`, `token`, `secret`, `key`, `auth` or `credential`, well-known token prefixes, and any 32+ character token-like string become `<redacted>`, `$HOME` becomes `~`, and the whole is capped at 200 characters. This is best effort: a secret passed as a bare git argument (`git commit -m hunter2`), or in an option whose name carries no secret word (`--push-option=secret=abc`), survives, and other absolute paths (for example `-C /path`) are kept, so treat the file as sensitive (it is created mode 0600). Long hex strings such as commit SHAs are redacted too. There is no rotation; delete the file to reset it.

Read it (the path defaults to the data directory when `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` is set; otherwise pass `--file`):

```sh
python3 hooks/report.py --file ~/.claude/plugins/data/eng-laws-eng-laws/blocks.jsonl summary
python3 hooks/report.py --file ... list --unreviewed
python3 hooks/report.py --file ... mark <id> --note "dry run, not a real revert"          # false positive (default)
python3 hooks/report.py --file ... mark <id> --verdict true-block
```

`summary` prints blocks, false positives (`fp`), confirmed true blocks (`true`) and unreviewed (`open`) per rule and per day. Marks are appended to the same file and the last mark for an id wins.

### Delegating to Codex (machine setup)

The laws reach Claude Code through the `@import` above and Codex through its own global instruction file. See the Delegation law for the policy. One-time setup per machine:

1. **Install the official plugin, pinned.** `claude plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc#v1.0.6 --scope user`, then `claude plugin install codex@openai-codex --scope user`, then `/codex:setup` (and `codex login` if it asks). Do not run `/codex:setup --enable-review-gate`: it makes two agents review each other in a loop and can drain usage quickly.
2. **Give Codex the same laws.** `ln -s ~/.claude/eng-laws/ENGINEERING_LAWS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. Codex reads `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` first and then each project `AGENTS.md` from the repository root down. Checked on 2026-10-27 with a read-only `codex exec` in a scratch repository whose `AGENTS.md` held a marker: Codex quoted the marker and the Cold Review law, so it followed the symlink and merged both files. Bumping the pinned checkout updates Claude and Codex together.
3. **Raise the instruction cap.** The Codex docs say it stops adding instruction files once their combined size reaches `project_doc_max_bytes` (32 KiB by default). Files load global first and then from the repository root down, so the project's files are the last added and the first to be cut. The laws alone are about 19 KB (19,304 bytes at this version). Set `project_doc_max_bytes = 65536` in `~/.codex/config.toml`; the cap and the cut order come from the docs and were not exercised.
4. **Keep a project's `AGENTS.md` to project parameters.** Do not copy the laws into it; two copies drift.

What the plugin does: `/codex:review` and `/codex:adversarial-review` are read-only; `/codex:rescue` hands a task to Codex, by default with a `workspace-write` sandbox and no approval prompts, in the git root of the session's working directory. It may tighten the wording of your task with its own prompting skill, but it adds no laws, so the laws arrive only through the files above. Its result comes back unreviewed. The rescue agent adds `--write` by default; to keep a rescue read-only, say so in the request (diagnosis or research only, no edits), which the agent's instructions treat as a reason to omit `--write`. The command has no working-directory option, so write delegation needs a Claude session started inside the worktree.

Not verified: whether the guard in this repository can be registered as a Codex `PreToolUse` hook (the Codex docs describe such an event with the same stdin JSON and exit-2 contract), whether Codex rules cover commands run inside its sandbox, and whether a worktree under a trusted project inherits the project's trust. Until those are verified, use Codex for read-only work only, per the Delegation law.

### Versioning

`version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the pin: installed repos stay on it until it changes. Every change that alters hook or agent behavior bumps `version` and gets a `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Add the marketplace at a tag (`#v0.1.0`) so adopters move only when they choose to.

## Repos using these conventions

Adoption status is tracked in each adopting project, not here.
